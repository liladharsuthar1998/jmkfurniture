JMK Furniture — Starter One-Page Website
Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- assets/logo.jpg (your provided logo)

What to do next:
1. Open index.html in a code editor (VS Code or simple text editor) to edit content.
2. Replace placeholder images in /assets with your real project photos. Name them descriptively: bedroom-wardrobe-01.jpg
3. Update contact details: phone, email, Google Business link, and the website URL in the JSON-LD inside index.html.
4. Make the contact form live:
   - Option A (easy): Use a form service like Formspree (formspree.io) or Getform; update the form 'action' attribute with the URL they give.
   - Option B (hosting): If you deploy to Netlify, you can use Netlify Forms.
5. Deploy:
   - Quick: Use Netlify (drag & drop the zip/unzipped folder into Netlify Deploy or connect a GitHub repo).
   - Or use GitHub Pages (push repo and enable Pages).
   - Or upload to your cPanel/hosting file manager (put files in public_html).
6. Point your domain to your host (update DNS A record or CNAME). If you need help with DNS, tell me your domain provider and I will give exact steps.
7. SEO & Local listings:
   - Claim or create Google Business profile for 'JMK Furniture' and add photos.
   - Add the site to Google Search Console and submit the sitemap (you can create sitemap.xml later).
8. Multilingual:
   - For English/Hindi/Gujarati, either create separate pages (example /hi or /gu) or use a plugin/service for translations.

If you want, I can:
- Generate alternate-language copies of the site text (Hindi & Gujarati).
- Create a printable one-page PDF brochure and WhatsApp catalog images.
- Convert this static page into a WordPress-friendly template.

Enjoy — the starter site files are in the ZIP attached below.
